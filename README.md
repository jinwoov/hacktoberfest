### *Challenges #4*

Should you choose to do this mission... 

Let create something cool together!  
In `Application` folder, I've started node app. Please build on top this application by adding **one line** of code. Again **ONE LINE** of code! This is to give other people to put their cool idea.

If you are brand new to coding. You can still participate by adding a comment to the function or variable and tell what you think that line is doing!! 

In node.js you can create a comment by adding `//` to the beginning of the statement. 

Lets get creative!
